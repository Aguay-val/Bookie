Bookie
========

Bookie is hopefully one day going to be a self-hostable bookmark application
like delicious. The goal is to be compatible and provide a set of tools around
the project such as command line client and browser plugins.

It's all out not even started yet, but this is all placeholder info as we work
to get the parts together.

What's going on?
================
I started this a few times and have pylons code in the pylons dir that never
got far. It's been moved off to the side, all progress and new code is moving
forward in the Bookie directory which is a Pyramid app going forward.
