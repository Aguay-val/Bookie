Bookie
========

Bookie is hopefully one day going to be a self-hostable bookmark application
like delicious. The goal is to be compatible and provide a set of tools around
the project such as command line client and browser plugins.

It's all out not even started yet, but this is all placeholder info as we work
to get the parts together.
