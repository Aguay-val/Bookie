Bookie
========
http://bmark.us

Bookie is hopefully one day going to be a self-hostable bookmark application
like delicious. The goal is to be compatible and provide a set of tools around
the project such as command line client and browser plugins.

It's all out not even started yet, but this is all placeholder info as we work
to get the parts together.


Using Bookie
-------------
For right now, I've forked over an open sourced Google Chrome plugin that does
simple posts to a delicious api compatible service. It works to save, but
doesn't do things like detect if you've already added it, etc.
