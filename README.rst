Bookie
========
:Docs: http://bmark.us

Bookie is hopefully one day going to be a self-hostable bookmark application
like delicious. The goal is to be compatible and provide a set of tools around
the project such as command line client and browser plugins.


Using Bookie
-------------
For right now, I've forked over an open sourced Google Chrome plugin that does
simple posts to a delicious api compatible service. It works to save, detects
if you've already bookmarked a page, and permits deletions.
