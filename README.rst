Bookie
========
:Docs: http://bmark.us

Bookie will one day be a self-hosted bookmark web-service similar to Delicious
with associated integration with command-line clients and browswer plugins.

Using Bookie with Google Chrome
-------------------------------
For now, there is a forked version of an open sourced Google Chrome plugin that does
simple posts to a delicious api compatible service. It can save, delete, and detect
if you've already bookmarked a page.
