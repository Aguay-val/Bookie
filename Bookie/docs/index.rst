   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Bookie's documentation!
==================================
Bookie is my attempt to rid myself of Delicious, and be able host my bookmarks
which I hold dear myself.

Beyond that, there's some features I think that are long overdue.

Upcoming Bookie Events
=======================
Check out the events_ schedule page for some dates of sprints and hacking times
for Bookie.

Using Bookie
============
So far, there's no real web interface. Personally, I use a Chrome extension for
most of my bookmark use and I'm starting there first. I've forked an open
source Chrome bookmark you can use to work with Bookie.
