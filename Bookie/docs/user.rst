Importing
----------
Currently importing only supports the delicious html export format. You can do
that by going to `Settings` and clicking the `Import / Upload Bookmarks` link
under the `Bookmarks` section.

The importer might take a bit on large sets of bookmarks. Let me know if you
run into any issues.

ToDo
-----
Look into other formats to import, create the ability to choose/detect the
import format for new importers.

Make sure we force submitting your API Key once that's complete as part of the
form submission. Help prevent people from using the importer against you.
