We're going to have the first ever Bookie sprint on Friday the 22nd of April.
Some potential goals:

- Work on getting the FF plugin working
- Some UI design/ideas pitching/feedback
- Test out the new readable parsing on everyone's batches of bookmarks
- Work on some docs updates and try to knock out a few items from the issue

The doors open up at 11am and we'll have some lunch delivered around 12:30pm.
I'll chase everyone away somewhere around 4pm.
