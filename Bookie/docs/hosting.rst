Hosting your Bookie installation
----------------------------------
Right now, we're in full developer mode so hosting is up to you. We help you
get started by running it with the built-in `paste` webserver locally.

However Bookie is a WSGI_ application and can be hosted with web servers such
as Apache, Nginx, and Cherokee. As Bookie matures we'll try to get cookbook
docs for using each. For now, it's up to you to figure out, but feel free to
drop by the *#bookie#* irc channel on Freenode for assistance..
